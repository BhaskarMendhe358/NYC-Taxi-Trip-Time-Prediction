# NYC-Taxi-Trip-Time-Prediction
Building the model to predict the taxi trip duration.

# Description of the Problem

Task is to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. Your primary dataset is one released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, which includes pickup time, geo-coordinates, number of passengers, and several other variables.

# Description of the data

The dataset is based on the 2016 NYC Yellow Cab trip record data made available in Big Query on Google Cloud Platform. The data was originally published by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). The data was sampled and cleaned for the purposes of this project. Based on individual trip attributes, you should predict the duration of each trip in the test set.

# Variables description
NYC Taxi Data.csv - the training set (contains 1458644 trip records)
Data fields
id - a unique identifier for each trip
vendor_id - a code indicating the provider associated with the trip record
pickup_datetime - date and time when the meter was engaged
dropoff_datetime - date and time when the meter was disengaged
passenger_count - the number of passengers in the vehicle (driver entered value)
pickup_longitude - the longitude where the meter was engaged
pickup_latitude - the latitude where the meter was engaged
dropoff_longitude - the longitude where the meter was disengaged
dropoff_latitude - the latitude where the meter was disengaged
store_and_fwd_flag - This flag indicates whether the trip record was held in vehicle memory before sending to the vendor because the vehicle did not have a connection to the server - Y=store and forward; N=not a store and forward trip
trip_duration - duration of the trip in seconds
